<h1>My Top Three Movies</h1>

<h2>The best movies accorsing to me</h2>

<hr >

<h3>1. Baby driver</h3>
<p>Baby driver is a really good movie because of music and the way it is shown in the movie.
For example when the main character baby goes to get coffe he is listening to a song and 
during the walk the sounds around him go with the song and he is feeling happy.
But later in the movie when he is feeling down the sounds don't match up he bumps somebody, 
and you can really feel for the character.</p>

<h3>2. A Quiet Place</h3>
<p>A quiet place is a really good movies becuase just the concept of living in silence is really cool and the way that the director and team paid attention to the very fine details like putting sand to make less noise and all the fine little details make this move a personal favourite.</p>

<h3>3. Interstellar</h3>
<p>Interstellar is a really good movie. I geniunly cried at the end and it was really good.</p>
